# surfs_up
Module 9 of DU Data Analytics bootcamp

## Overview of Project
The use and storage of data sometimes does not allow for large and complex database structures. Sometimes the use of those tools is also just overkill. Much of development is similar to any other building task, to have top-notch quality while also being efficient. This module was dedicated to learning some of the tools necessary for certain jobs where a full-fledged database is not necessary and/or practical: enter SQLite and Flask.

### Purpose of Project
Small businesses, while certainly not dominating the bulk of economic markets in volume, are powerful and necessary agents in a healthy system. Small businesses often are the birthplace of significant innovation. But as markets grow, and ever increase in their complexity (which they always do!), even small businesses must make use of relevant data to inform decision-making. The best decisions are often the difference makers between a great idea and a realized product/service that shakes up the market. This is what leads to actually making an impact.

The goal of this pseudo-entrepreneur is to build a successful beachside business to share the passion of surfing along with some fine refreshments. And if the self-starter person behind all of it gets to quit their day job, move to an exotic beach location, and run operations under the sun and within view of the waves, then mission accomplished!

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Module


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on the Challenge


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Everything is coming together! We're using Python and Pandas to develop data analysis. We're using SQL and SqlAlchemy to build databases and retreive information from them. We're using Matplotlib to create visualizations that make it easier to communicate the story that our data is telling. And we're using a front-end application (Flask) so that we can present what we've built on the back-end to a mass audience.

One of the challenges, certainly, is keeping up with and soaking in all of the information. But there is nothing more satisfying than doing this kind of work. On a personal note, I am on multiple platforms (HackerRank, SoloLearn, GitHub, Kaggle, w3Schools) practicing the various languages every day. It's a huge time investment, but this is something I love. I'm implementing what the knowledge to build some really cool stuff in my current role, and I have plans for even bigger and cooler things. It's a challenge to build the knowledge base and skill set, but it's a challenge that I have fully embraced and I am passionate and excited about.
