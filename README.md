# surfs_up
Module 9 of DU Data Analytics bootcamp

## Overview of Project
The use and storage of data sometimes does not allow for large and complex database structures. Sometimes the use of those tools is also just overkill. Much of development is similar to any other building task, to have top-notch quality while also being efficient. This module was dedicated to learning some of the tools necessary for certain jobs where a full-fledged database is not necessary and/or practical: enter SQLite and Flask.

### Purpose of Project
Small businesses, while certainly not dominating the bulk of economic markets in volume, are powerful and necessary agents in a healthy system. Small businesses often are the birthplace of significant innovation. But as markets grow, and ever increase in their complexity (which they always do!), even small businesses must make use of relevant data to inform decision-making. The best decisions are often the difference makers between a great idea and a realized product/service that shakes up the market. This is what leads to actually making an impact.

The goal of this pseudo-entrepreneur is to build a successful beachside business to share the passion of surfing along with some fine refreshments. And if the self-starter person behind all of it gets to quit their day job, move to an exotic beach location, and run operations under the sun and within view of the waves, then mission accomplished!
